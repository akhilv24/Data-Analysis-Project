# 📊 Cognifyz Internship – Data Analysis Project

This repository contains tasks completed during my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, focused on restaurant data analysis.

---

## ✅ Tasks Overview

### 🔍 EDA & Preprocessing
- Explored dataset dimensions (rows and columns)
- Handled missing values and performed data type conversions
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (`Aggregate rating`)

### 📈 Descriptive Analysis
- Calculated basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Explored categorical variables: `Country Code`, `City`, `Cuisines`
- Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants

### 🌍 Geospatial Analysis
- Visualized restaurant locations using latitude and longitude
- Analyzed distribution across cities and countries
- Explored correlation between location and ratings

### 🍽️ Table Booking & Delivery Analysis
- Determined percentage of restaurants with table booking and online delivery
- Compared average ratings based on booking and delivery availability
- Analyzed delivery availability across different price ranges

### 💰 Price Range Analysis
- Identified most common price ranges
- Calculated average rating per price range
- Determined which color code represents the highest average rating

### 🛠 Feature Engineering
- Extracted new features (e.g., name/address length)
- Created encoded features like `Has Table Booking` and `Has Online Delivery`

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- Built regression models to predict aggregate ratings
- Split data into training and test sets
- Evaluated models using metrics (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

### 📊 Customer Insights
- Analyzed cuisine types in relation to rating
- Identified most popular cuisines based on number of votes
- Highlighted cuisines receiving the highest ratings

### 📉 Visualizations
- Created histograms, bar plots, and other charts for data exploration
- Compared average ratings by cuisines and cities
- Visualized feature relationships with the target variable
